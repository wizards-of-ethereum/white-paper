# Wizards Of Ethereum

## Abstract
Blockchain technology has applications in a variety of fields, mainly in finance, but there are also other fields where can be a game-changer.

Today, we live in a hyper-connected world where we can enjoy the work of many visual artists almost for free, from their Instagram profiles, Blogs, etc. And most of these artists do not make any profit from their work despite their talent.

I am a big fan of sci-fi art, games, and collectibles such as Magic The Gathering, and I know from experience that there is a market for collectibles, from baseball cards to trading card games, postal stamps, etc.

As human beings, we love to collect curious stuff that makes us feel good or specials. In the digital era, a lot of young people are willing to acquire digital goods or assets.

Blockchain technology empowers us to create unique digital assets that can be purchased and stored in distributed systems.

Ethereum Blockchain gives us the ERC721 tokens. ERC721 tokens are useful in situations like real estate or collectibles, where some items are valued more than others. 

Due to their usefulness, rarity or uniqueness, the ERC721 is a standard for representing ownership of non-fungible tokens, that is, where each token is unique.

## What is Wizards Of Ethereum?
Wizards Of Ethereum is an effort to bring three things together, blockchain technology, beautiful art, and great stories. And in the middle, rewarding artists for their work.

Wizards Of Ethereum will be a set of universe expansions, starting with the Genesis. Each universe expansion will have a unique thematic that will be a point of departure for artists to start creating the universe story.

Before an expansion gets launched, there will be an open convocation for artists to submit their work with guidelines of the expansion thematic.

Once the convocation is closed, then the stakeholders of the WOET (Wizards Of Ethereum Token) will vote on the artists' pieces to decide which will be mint as an NFT (Non-Fungible Token) or, in the context of Wizards Of Ethereum, Legends.

The legends created as the result of the votation will be sent to the artist account. The value of the Legends is assigned algorithmically (more on this at the technical overview).

When a Legend is purchased, the amount paid is distributed between the artist and the stakeholders. 

The artist keeps the eighty percent of the value. The other twenty percent is distributed among the stakeholders.
